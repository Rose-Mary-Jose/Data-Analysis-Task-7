The script begins by importing the essential librariesâ€”sqlite3 for database operations, pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib for visualizations. It then establishes a connection to an SQLite database file named "sales_data.db" and obtains a cursor for executing SQL commands. To ensure a clean slate, any existing 'sales' table is dropped. A new 'sales' table is then created with defined columns: product, category, region, quantity, price, and date_sold. Sample sales data is assembled in a list of tuples, with each tuple containing values that correspond to the table's columns. This data is inserted into the newly created table using an executemany command, and the changes are committed to the database. Following this, the script verifies data insertion by fetching and printing all rows from the 'sales' table. A SQL query is then executed to aggregate the sales data by product, calculating both the total quantity and total revenue (by multiplying quantity and price), with the results grouped by product. These results are loaded into a pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame is subsequently used to create several visualizations: a bar chart depicting the total revenue by product, a stacked bar chart that compares both revenue and total quantity, a pie chart showing the proportional revenue contribution of each product, and an area chart that illustrates the cumulative revenue trend. Each visualization is formatted with appropriate titles, axis labels, and layout adjustments, and they are displayed using matplotlib's show function.
